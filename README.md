<h2>LET'S START WITH 25 STUPIDEST THINGS HE'S SAID, THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO STUPID THINGS HE'S DONE</h2>
<cite>America's beloved Commander in Queef</cite>

<p>Whether you love him or hate him, Donald Trump is undoubtedly unafraid to speak his mind - 
even if it means getting ridiculed mercilessly by the internet.</p>

<p>From the invention of "covfefe" (does anyone know what that is yet?), to the claim that you 
"can't be too greedy" (and don't we know it), there's truly no shortage of comedy gold that 
leaves the president's mouth.</p>

<p>So, naturally, we've rounded up the 25 stupidest things Donald Trump has ever said... subjectively, 
of course.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>The Biden administration spent $8 million 
    <a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-transgender-mice-speech-trending-memes">
	making mice transgender</a>.<br>
    In Trump’s first joint address since taking office in January, he praised his own stance on 
	DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) initiatives, tax cuts and trade tariffs. But, viewers 
	were quick to point out the moment that saw the president claim that the Biden administration 
	had spent $8 million dollars to make “mice transgender”.<br>
    The comment drew laughs from those in the audience, as well as online, as people believed 
	Trump appeared to be confusing it with “transgenic mice”.<br>
    Making mice transgenic is a revolutionary process by which scientists add human cells to mice 
	to enable them to more accurately study the effect of disease on human tissues.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-spain-bric-nation-2670974952">
    Spain is reportedly a ‘BRICS’ country</a>.<br>
	In his first major blunder since becoming president for 
	the second time, Trump claimed that Spain is a ‘BRICS’ country during a press conference, where 
	he was asked about defence spending in the country.<br>
    He claimed: “They’re a BRICS nation, Spain. Do you know what a BRICS nation is? You’ll 
	figure it out.”<br>
    BRICS refers to a bloc of 10 developing economies, including Brazil, Russia, India, China 
	and South Africa, of which no EU member nation is a part.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-washington-dc-plane-crash-dei">
    Blaming Washington plane crash on DEI</a>.<br>
	Following the tragic plane crash between a helicopter 
	and an American Airlines flight in Washington DC in January 2025, Trump took the opportunity to 
	blame diversity and inclusion.<br>
    "I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary, you remember 
	that only the highest aptitude they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically 
	superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers”, he said.<br>
    "Then when I left office and Biden took over, he changed them back to lower than ever 
	before. I put safety first.<br>
    "The initiative is part of the FAA's (Federal Aviation Administration) 'diversity and 
	inclusion hiring plan', which says diversity is 'integral to achieving the FAA's mission 
	of ensuring safe and efficient travel'. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think it's 
	just the opposite."</li>
  <li>He won’t deport Prince Harry because 
    <a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/trump-prince-harry-meghan-markle">
	“he’s got enough problems with Meghan”</a><br>
    When Trump vowed to introduce mass deportations should he become president, he was quizzed 
	on the fate of British royal Prince Harry. However, it looks like Harry’s all good for now, 
	as Trump says he’d let him stay because he has “enough problems” with his wife, Meghan.<br>
    “I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife – she’s terrible”, he quipped.</li>
  <li>Trump refers to himself as 
	<a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-the-king-truth-social-backlash">
	“the King”</a> - immediately faces backlash.<br>
	It’s no secret that Trump thinks a lot of himself, but when he referred to himself as the 
	“king”, people weren’t so willing to go along with it.<br>
    “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE 
	KING!”, he wrote on Truth Social, referencing the scrapping of new tolls in the city’s 
	mass transit system.<br>
    New York governor Kathy Hochul, simply responded: “We are a nation of laws, not ruled 
	by a king. We’ll see you in court.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-denmark-greenland">
    Trump says Denmark “doesn’t have right” to Greenland</a>, despite it belonging to them.<br>
	The US is involved in an ongoing dispute over Greenland as Trump wants the land to 
	be America’s, even claiming that Denmark doesn’t have the “right” to the country - 
	except he missed one major fact.<br>
    Greenland is a self-governing, autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark and has 
	been part of Denmark for 600 years despite being 1,815 miles away (for context, the 
	distance between Greenland and the US is 3,134 miles).<br>
    Greenland’s outgoing Prime Minister, Mute Egede, fired back at Trump’s comments in a 
    Facebook post where he wrote: “The U.S. president has once again aired the thought of 
    annexing us."<br>
    “Enough is enough,” he added and shared his plans to organise a meeting of the chairmen 
	of all Greenland’s political parties “as soon as possible” to discuss Trump’s latest 
	remarks. Yikes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/news/donald-trump-lie-are-egg-prices-down">
    Claims egg prices have dropped 30 per cent in a week</a> - they went up 28 per cent since 
	he took office Donald Trump bending the truth? There’s just no way. Except, he did just 
	claim US egg prices went down 30 per cent in one week alone, when they’ve actually gone 
	up quite significantly.<br>
    "I don't know if you saw. Little things such as the cost of eggs – little to you, but 
	big to the people out there. Down almost 30 per cent, in the last, eh, few days”, he 
	said during a press conference on 12 March, 2025.<br>
    Even Serena Williams' former coach Rennae Stubbs chimed in on the action, writing: 
	"This dude lies as much as he draws breath."</li>
  <li>Jabs at Zelensky that he’s <a href="https://www.indy100.com/news/elon-musk-donald-trump-zelensky-suit">
    ‘all dressed up’</a> while wearing military-style uniform. Everyone remembers that infamous 
	White House meeting between Donald Trump and President Zelensky when they sought to find a 
	peace solution between Ukraine and Russia - but it would seem things were never going to 
	end well right off the bat.<br>
    Ahead of a meeting in the Oval Office with JD Vance and Zelensky, Trump greeted the 
	Ukrainian president with a comment, saying: "Oh look, you’re all dressed up."<br>
    Zelensky was seen dressed in a black, long-sleeved polo shirt featuring the Ukrainian 
    trident, which Vance would later go on to criticise, as he’d chosen not to wear a suit. 
    The Ukrainian has not worn a suit since Russia’s invasion began, and instead opted for 
    a uniform likened to his soldiers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-canada-mexico-trade-deal">
    Donald Trump asks who signed deal with Mexico and Canada</a> (he did)<br>
    Trade tariffs continue to be a hot topic for US president Donald Trump, but when he tried 
	to play the blame game it ultimately backfired, after social media users pointed out an 
	important fact relating to the situation.<br>
    During a White House press conference alongside French president Emmanuel Macron on 
	Monday (February 24), Trump was asked about trade between the US and neighbouring 
    countries Mexico and Canada.<br>
    "I mean who can blame if they made these great deals with the United States, took 
	advantage of the United States on manufacturing, on just about everything - every 
	aspect that you could imagine they took advantage of," he said.<br>
    "I look at some of these agreements and I say who would ever sign a thing like this. 
	The tariffs will go forward, yes. We’ll make up a lot of territory. Our country will 
	be liquid and rich again."<br>
    It was Trump who signed “those things”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/news/can-trump-run-for-a-third-term-president-explained">
    Trump drops hint he’ll run for third term</a> - despite it being illegal<br>
    When he made it back into office for a second time, Trump was already setting his sights on 
	a third term in the White House - except, that’s not allowed.<br>
    On February 20, Trump delivered a speech at a Black History Month event at the White House 
	where he boasted about receiving "more votes from Black Americans than any Republican 
	president ever."<br>
    "I won’t be happy the next time," he continued, adding: "Should I run again? You tell me."<br>
    However, despite Trump's hints, the 22nd Amendment states that it isn't possible.<br>
    "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person 
    who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a 
	term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of 
	the President more than once," it reads according to the National Constitution Center.<br>
    However, he's since backtracked (as of May 2025) and says he's "not looking" at running again.</li>
  <li>Vows to <a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-plastic-straws-2671150178">
    bring back plastic straws because paper ones ‘explode in minutes’</a>
    While we’re often torn on whether we love the planet or being able to drink a Diet Coke 
	in peace more, Trump has made his feelings about the plastic straw ban clear - and vowed 
	to reverse it.<br>
    "These things don't work, I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they 
    explode. If something's hot, they don't last very long, like a matter of minutes, 
	sometimes a matter of seconds. It's a ridiculous situation," he said, speaking about 
	paper straws, before immediately signing an executive order to bring the trusty plastic 
	ones back.<br>
    Trump doesn't seem too concerned about plastic straws polluting the planet and thinks 
	“it’s OK” to keep using them.<br>
    The president added: “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much 
	as they’re ... munching their way through the ocean".</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-windmills-whales">
    Donald Trump isn’t a fan of windmills</a>
    Trump hates a lot of those things, and who knew one of those things would be windmills? 
	The 78-year-old described the wind farms as "garbage" and said that when in office, his 
	administration plans to implement policies to stop building them.<br>
    “They are dangerous,” Trump said on the matter. “You see what’s happening up in the 
    Massachusetts area with the whales … The windmills are driving the whales crazy, obviously.”<br>
    This is a topic Trump has been vocal about during his presidential election campaign 
	as he pledged the number of wind farms would be slashed if reelected.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-american-citizenship-bizarre">
    Trump shares bizarre take on how citizenship works</a><br>
	Donald Trump is infamous for saying completely outrageous remarks, making dubious 
	decisions and just generally things that make you go: "Eh?"<br>
	And he's done it again, this time about American citizenship.<br>
	Trump recently spoke with NBC News about his aim to end birthright citizenship and 
	said American citizens with family in the country illegally may be deported.<br>
	"Did you know, if somebody sets a foot - just a foot, one foot, you don't need two - 
	on our land, congratulations, you are now a citizen of the United States of America”, 
	he said.<br>
    "Yes, we're going to end that because it's ridiculous. We're the only country that has 
	it, you know. You know we're the only country that has it."<br>
    Trump here is seemingly describing an outrageous scenario where a woman would give birth 
	to an infant that could have one foot in America and another in another country like 
	Mexico and Canada.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-liz-cheney-tucker">
    Trump fantasises about Liz Cheney being shot</a><br>
    At a time where gender-based violence is rife, it’s actually rather shocking that 
	Donald Trump once publicly fantasised about Liz Cheney being shot.<br>
    Trump branded Ms Cheney – the daughter of Dick Cheney, the former Republican vice 
	president, who has come out in support of Trump’s rival Kamala Harris – a “very dumb 
	individual” and a “radical war hawk”.<br>
    “Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, let’s 
	see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face,” he 
	said. Yikes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-us-garbage-can">
    Trump brands the US ‘a garbage can’</a><br>
    Trump’s signature slogan ‘Make America Great Again’ didn’t come from nowhere - and it 
	makes sense given that he made his feelings about the state of the US under Joe Biden 
	clear.<br>
    Speaking in Tempe while on his campaign trail, Trump said: “We’re like a garbage can, 
	you know, it’s the first time I’ve ever said that, and every time I come up and talk 
	about what they’ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I’ve ever said garbage 
	can, but you know what, it’s a very accurate description.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-harris-pennsylvania-rally">
    Trump brands Harris a ’shit’ vice president</a><br>
    Before being re-elected as president, it was clear Trump was willing to do anything to 
	secure his second term - even if that meant making his feelings about the current 
	administration at the time clear and unfiltered.<br>
	In the same rally speech which saw him ramble about the penis size of late US golfer 
	Arnold Palmer, the former Apprentice star took aim at then-vice president Kamala Harris 
	using rather colourful language.<br>
    He told his supporters: “We have to tell Kamala Harris that you’ve had enough, that you 
	just can’t take it anymore. We can’t stand you, you’re a shit vice president. The worst.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech">
    Trump takes aim at ‘fat husbands’ as he tries to win over voters</a><br>
    By October 2024, Trump had done a number of rallies on his campaign trail, and frankly, 
	must have been clutching at straws to win over voters.<br>
	Donald Trump used his speech at his Michigan rally on 18 October to go after an imaginary 
	woman named ‘Jill’ and tell her “fat husband” to get “off the couch” and “vote for Trump” 
	– yes, really.<br>
	“Early voting is underway so get everyone you know and get out and vote. Go tomorrow, it’s 
	just starting, go and vote, make sure you vote, and bring all our friends that want to vote 
	for us, tell them: ‘Jill, get your fat husband off the couch. Get that fat pig off the couch”, 
	he told the crowd.<br>
	“’Time to go and vote for Trump, he’s going to save our country’ … Get him up, Jill. Slap him 
	around, get him up!”</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-father-of-ivf">
    Trump claims he’s the ‘father’ of IVF</a><br>
    Donald Trump labelled himself the “father of IVF” in an awkward moment in front of an 
	all-female audience of voters, as he attempted to win them over in the 2024 election.<br>
    It comes as many fear rights to IVF may become threatened under a Republican, Trump-led 
	government.<br>
	It happened during a Fox News town hall in the key election battleground of Georgia, when 
	the issue of reproductive rights and IVF (In vitro fertilization) came up, and he scrambled 
	for an answer.<br>
	Vice-President Kamala Harris, who was also running for president, called the comment “quite 
	bizarre”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-pennsylvania-rally-supporter-killed-joke">
    Trump makes joke about supporter being killed at Pennsylvania rally</a><br>
	Donald Trump made a joke at a private fundraiser referencing the widow of Corey Comperatore, 
	the supporter who was killed during the assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania 
	in July, according to a report.<br>
	The Guardian reported it obtained a 12 minute recording from a dinner held in Aspen, Colorado 
	on August 10 in which he was heard swearing, claiming a group of "murderers" came to America 
	after being released from prison in another country and making a joke at the expense of 
	Comperatore's family.<br>
    Trump reportedly said: "So they're going to get millions of dollars but the woman, the 
	wife, this beautiful woman, I handed her the cheque - we handed her the cheque - and 
	she said, 'this is so nice, and I appreciate it, but I'd much rather have my husband'.<br>
	"Now, I know some of the women in this room wouldn't say the same.<br>
	"I know at least four couples. There are four couples, Governor [Abbott], that I know 
	and you're not one of them. At least four couples here would have been thrilled, actually."</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-the-purge-crime">
    Donald Trump says a day like The Purge would ‘curb crime’</a><br>
    During the election campaign, Trump said giving police "one really violent day" to 
	tackle crime such as theft from stores would help to stop people stealing in what's 
	been described as "one of the most dangerous speeches of the 21st Century".<br>
	Trump spoke at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania on September 29, claiming crime rates are 
	skyrocketing (something the far right consistently falsely claims to cause fear) and it's 
	primarily the fault of migrants.<br>
	He went on to say this could be dealt with in a way similar to the dystopian action horror 
	film series The Purge where all crime, even murder, is legal for a 12-hour period. Not a 
	wise choice, if you ask us.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/trump-change-name-ai-artificial-intelligence">
    Trump wants to rename AI - and his suggestion makes no sense</a><br>
    Donald Trump doesn't like artificial intelligence... well, the name at least, as he bizarrely 
	requested for AI to be called something else.<br>
	(Because renaming the "Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America” for federal agencies wasn't enough.)<br>
	The US president was in attendance at an artificial intelligence summit on 24 July when he 
	decided to make this linguistic query during a speech.<br>
	"Around the globe everyone is talking about artificial intelligence. I find that too artificial, 
	I can’t stand it. I don’t even like the name,” Trump said, tossing his hands up in the air.<br>
    "It’s not artificial. It’s genius. It’s pure genius," he said of the developing technology.<br>
	We're not sure that one will catch on.</li>
  <li>Donald Trump expects another 'thank you' for doing the right thing<br>
    Following a bust-up over Ukraine, it seems Trump expects another ‘thank you’ for helping 
	a warzone – this time concerning the ongoing devastation in Gaza.<br>
    Speaking in Scotland on Sunday, with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen 
    sitting next to him, the US president told reporters: “We gave $60 million, two weeks ago 
    - and nobody even acknowledged it – for food.<br>
    “It’s terrible. You know, you really at least want to have somebody to say ‘thank you’ … 
    Nobody acknowledged it, nobody talks about it, and it makes you feel a little bad when 
    you do that.<br>
    “Nobody gave but us, and nobody said, ‘gee, thank you very much’, and it would be nice to 
	have at least a thank you.”<br>
    How very charitable.

<li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/trump-claims-to-be-only-president-to-donate-his-salary-and-everyone-is-saying-the-same-thing">Trump claims he's the only president ever to have donated 
his salary</a>
Donald Trump has made a wild claim about his presidential salary, but everyone is 
saying the same thing.

The US president has made many wild claims throughout his presidency, from outlandish 
claims about drug prices to the suggestion he’s “shook more hands than any human is 
capable of”.

In his most recent brag on Truth Social, Trump suggested he is “the only President” to 
have donated his salary – $400,000 annually.

While his claim of being the only president to do so is false (several of his predecessors 
including John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover donated their presidential salaries), many 
have also highlighted how he has spent eye-watering sums of public money on playing golf, 
and also made billions while in office.

According to the tracking website Did Trump Golf Today?, 24.5 per cent of Trump’s presidency 
has been spent golfing.

<li><a href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/trump-maths-drug-prices-claim">Not 
understanding how prices work</a>

Donald Trump's maths is coming under scrutiny once again following his latest claim about 
cutting drug prices - and the verdict is it still doesn't add up...

The president was asked what advice he has for Republicans on Capitol Hill heading into 
the midterms, and that's when Trump brought up the bizarre claim about the "tremendous 
drop in drug prices".

“You know, we’ve cut drug prices by 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500 per cent,” he said.

This clip began making the rounds on social media, where Trump's stats were swiftly 
criticised as they schooled the commander-in-chief that his calculations would mean 
Americans would be paid to receive their medication.
